jobDeck is an employee/employer matching site looking to pair Tech professionals with leaders in the Tech Industry. Our developmental focus was on creating a site where developers, team leads, recruiters, and more can connect based on skillset rather than networking ability.

jobDeck was created using React, Redux, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, and Google Firebase
